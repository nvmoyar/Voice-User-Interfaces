    "LibriSpeech is a corpus of approximately 1000 hours of 16kHz read English speech, prepared by Vassil Panayotov with the assistance of Daniel Povey. The data is derived from read audiobooks from the LibriVox project, and has been carefully segmented and aligned. This is a free data set of English sentences matched with audio files. With over 1000 hours of public domain book content, it is appropriate for ASR training.\n",
